To get started, have a look at one of the examples. Hopefully you will find the API pleasant to work with :)

== Getting SSHJ

To get SSHJ, you have two options:

. Add a dependency to SSHJ to your project.
. Build SSHJ yourself.

And, if you want, you can also run the SSHJ examples.

Binary releases of SSHJ are not provided here, but you can download it http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7C{sshj_groupid}%7Csshj%7C{sshj_version}%7Cjar[straight from the Maven Central repository] if you want to.

== Depending on SSHJ
If you're building your project using Maven, you can add the following dependency to the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>{sshj_groupid}</groupId>
  <artifactId>sshj</artifactId>
  <version>{sshj_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If your project is built using another build tool that uses the Maven Central repository, translate this dependency into the format used by your build tool.

== Building SSHJ
. Clone the SSHJ repository.
. Ensure you have Java6 installed with the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html[Unlimited strength Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE)].
. Run the command `./gradlew clean build`.

== Running the examples
In the `examples` directory, there is a separate Maven project that shows how the library can be used in some sample cases. If you want to run them, follow these guidelines:

. Install http://maven.apache.org/[Maven 2.2.1] or up.
. Clone the Overthere repository.
. Go into the `examples` directory and run the command `mvn eclipse:eclipse`.
. Import the `examples` project into Eclipse.
. Change the login details in the example classes (address, username and password) and run them!

== Features of the library include:

* reading known_hosts files for host key verification
* publickey, password and keyboard-interactive authentication
* command, subsystem and shell channels
* local and remote port forwarding
* scp + complete sftp version 0-3 implementation

== Supported algorithms
Implementations / adapters for the following algorithms are included:

If you need something that is not included, it shouldn't be too hard to add (do contribute it!)

== Comparing to other implementations
http://ssh-comparison.quendi.de/comparison.html[SSH Implementation Comparison]

== Dependencies
Java 6+. http://www.slf4j.org/download.html[slf4j] is required. http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[bouncycastle] is highly recommended and required for using some of the crypto algorithms. http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/[jzlib] is required for using zlib compression.

SSHJ 0.17.1 (2016-07-06)::
* Improved parsing of the SSH Server identification. Too long header lines now no longer break the protocol.
SSHJ 0.17.0 (2016-07-05)::
* *Introduced breaking change in SFTP copy behaviour*: Previously an SFTP copy operation would behave differently if both source and target were folders with different names.
  In this case instead of copying the contents of the source into the target directory, the directory itself was copied as a sub directory of the target directory.
  This behaviour has been removed in favour of the default behaviour which is to copy the contents of the source into the target. Bringing the behaviour in line with how SCP works.
