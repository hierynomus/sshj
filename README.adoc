= sshj - SSHv2 library for Java

image::https://travis-ci.org/hierynomus/sshj.svg?branch=master[]

To get started, have a look at one of the examples. Hopefully you will find the API pleasant to work with :)

== Features of the library include:

* reading known_hosts files for host key verification
* publickey, password and keyboard-interactive authentication
* command, subsystem and shell channels
* local and remote port forwarding
* scp + complete sftp version 0-3 implementation

== Supported algorithms

Implementations / adapters for the following algorithms are included:

ciphers::
  `aes{128,192,256}-{cbc,ctr}`, `blowfish-cbc`, `3des-cbc`

key exchange::
  `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`

signatures::
  `ssh-rsa`, `ssh-dss`

mac::
  `hmac-md5`, `hmac-md5-96`, `hmac-sha1`, `hmac-sha1-96`

compression::
  `zlib` and `zlib@openssh.com` (delayed zlib)

private key files::
   `pkcs8` encoded (what openssh uses)

If you need something that is not included, it shouldn't be too hard to add (do contribute it!)


== Dependencies

Java 6+. http://www.slf4j.org/download.html[slf4j] is required. http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[bouncycastle] is highly recommended and required for using some of the crypto algorithms. http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/[jzlib] is required for using zlib compression.
